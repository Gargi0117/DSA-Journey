# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms Journey

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** journey 👋  
This repository is a structured log of my progress in building **strong problem-solving skills** for **technical interviews and internships**.

Rather than chasing problem counts, the focus here is on:
- recognizing patterns,
- writing clean and optimized code,
- and explaining solutions clearly.

---

## 🎯 Why This Repository?

✔ To build solid DSA fundamentals  
✔ To practice interview-relevant problem patterns  
✔ To track consistent progress publicly  
✔ To create verifiable proof of problem-solving skills

## ✍️ How Each Problem Is Solved

Every solution follows a consistent format:

1. **Problem Statement**  
2. **Approach / Intuition**  
3. **Algorithm**  
4. **Time Complexity**  
5. **Space Complexity**  
6. **Edge Cases**

This structure helps in **fast revision** and **clear interview explanation**.

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

> Solve less. Understand more.

- Think in **patterns**, not memorized solutions  
- Optimize only after correctness  
- Explain solutions out loud  
- Consistency > speed  

---

## 🎯 End Goal

To become **internship-ready** with the ability to:
- confidently solve unseen problems,  
- write efficient and readable code,  
- and clearly communicate logic during interviews.

## 🤝 Contributions & Feedback

This is a personal learning repository,  
but suggestions, better approaches, and optimizations are always welcome!
